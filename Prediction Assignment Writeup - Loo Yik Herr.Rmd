## Summary

This document is the final report of the Peer Assessment project from the Practical Machine Learning course and it is written and coded in RStudio. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the 6 participants performed the exercises. The machine learning algorithm, which uses the classe variable in the training set, is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data.

## Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

## Data Import and Wrangling

Load packages and set seed
```{r cars}
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)

set.seed(222)
```
Load data for training and test datasets.
```{r}
url_train <- "./pml-training.csv"
url_quiz  <- "./pml-testing.csv"

data_train <- read.csv(url_train, strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA",""))
data_quiz  <- read.csv(url_quiz,  strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA",""))

dim(data_train)
```
```{r}
dim(data_quiz)
```
Create two partitions (75% and 25%) within the original training dataset.
```{r}
in_train  <- createDataPartition(data_train$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
train_set <- data_train[ in_train, ]
test_set  <- data_train[-in_train, ]

dim(train_set)
```

```{r}
dim(test_set)
```

The two datasets (train_set and test_set) have a large number of NA values as well as near-zero-variance (NZV) variables. Both will be removed together with their ID variables.
```{r}
nzv_var <- nearZeroVar(train_set)

train_set <- train_set[ , -nzv_var]
test_set  <- test_set [ , -nzv_var]

dim(train_set)
```
```{r}
dim(test_set)
```
Remove variables that are mostly NA. A threshlod of 95 % is selected.
```{r}
na_var <- sapply(train_set, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
train_set <- train_set[ , na_var == FALSE]
test_set  <- test_set [ , na_var == FALSE]

dim(train_set)
```

```{r}
dim(test_set)
```
Since columns 1 to 5 are identification variables only, they will be removed as well.
```{r}
train_set <- train_set[ , -(1:5)]
test_set  <- test_set [ , -(1:5)]

dim(train_set)
```
```{r}
dim(test_set)
```
The number of variables for the analysis has been reduced from the original 160 down to 54.

## Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis between the variables before the modeling work itself is done. The “FPC” is used as the first principal component order.

```{r}
corr_matrix <- cor(train_set[ , -54])
corrplot(corr_matrix, order = "FPC", method = "circle", type = "lower",
         tl.cex = 0.6, tl.col = rgb(0, 0, 0))
```
If two variables are highly correlated their colors are either dark blue (for a positive correlation) or dark red (for a negative correlations). Because there are only few strong correlations among the input variables, the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) will not be performed in this analysis. Instead, a few different prediction models will be built to have a better accuracy.

## Prediction Models

### Decision Tree Model

```{r}
set.seed(2222)
fit_decision_tree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = train_set, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(fit_decision_tree)
```
Predictions of the decision tree model on test_set.
```{r}
predict_decision_tree <- predict(fit_decision_tree, newdata = test_set, type="class")
conf_matrix_decision_tree <- confusionMatrix(predict_decision_tree, factor(test_set$classe))
conf_matrix_decision_tree
```

The predictive accuracy of the decision tree model is relatively low at 75.2 %.

Plot the predictive accuracy of the decision tree model.

```{r}
plot(conf_matrix_decision_tree$table, col = conf_matrix_decision_tree$byClass, 
     main = paste("Decision Tree Model: Predictive Accuracy =",
                  round(conf_matrix_decision_tree$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```
### Generalized Boosted Model (GBM)

```{r}
set.seed(2222)
ctrl_GBM <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 2)
fit_GBM  <- train(classe ~ ., data = train_set, method = "gbm",
                  trControl = ctrl_GBM, verbose = FALSE)
fit_GBM$finalModel
```
Predictions of the GBM on test_set.

```{r}
predict_GBM <- predict(fit_GBM, newdata = test_set)
conf_matrix_GBM <- confusionMatrix(predict_GBM, factor(test_set$classe))
conf_matrix_GBM
```

The predictive accuracy of the GBM is relatively high at 98.57 %.

### Random Forest Model
```{r}
set.seed(2222)
ctrl_RF <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 2)
fit_RF  <- train(classe ~ ., data = train_set, method = "rf",
                  trControl = ctrl_RF, verbose = FALSE)
fit_RF$finalModel
```

Predictions of the random forest model on test_set.
```{r}
predict_RF <- predict(fit_RF, newdata = test_set)
conf_matrix_RF <- confusionMatrix(predict_RF, factor(test_set$classe))
conf_matrix_RF
```

The predictive accuracy of the Random Forest model is excellent at 99.8 %.


## Applying the Best Predictive Model to the Test Data

The following are the predictive accuracy of the three models:

- Decision Tree Model: 75.20 %
- Generalized Boosted Model: 98.57 %
- Random Forest Model: 99.80 %
The Random Forest model is selected and applied to make predictions on the 20 data points from the original testing dataset (data_quiz).

```{r}
#create a new dataframe with the predictions
predDF <- data.frame(predict_decision_tree, predict_GBM, predict_RF, classe =  test_set$classe)
#create a new model using the new data frame and rf method
combModFit <- train(classe ~.,method="rf",data=predDF)

#predict values and calculate the confusion matrix to check the accuracy
combPred <- predict(combModFit, predDF)
confusionMatrix(combPred, test_set$classe)$overall['Accuracy']
```
Stacked Accuracy: 99.83% is better than individual models such as decision tree, generalized boosted and random forest models.
